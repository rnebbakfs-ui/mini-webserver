#  MiniWeb — A Minimal Python Web Framework

MiniWeb is a lightweight educational web framework built from scratch to help beginners understand the **core concepts of backend development** without relying on large frameworks like Flask or Django.

This project teaches:

- How HTTP requests work  
- How routing works internally  
- How web frameworks parse headers, bodies, and query parameters  
- How servers handle sockets and connections  
- How responses are structured  

Perfect for students, backend beginners, and anyone preparing to build more advanced projects.
